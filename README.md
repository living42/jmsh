# jmsh

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/living42/jmsh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/living42/jmsh)

Connect servers managed by [Jumpserver](https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver) using traditional terminal.

## How to use it

jmsh is a JavaScript application run on top of Node, so you can run `npm install -g jmsh` to install it, then run `jmsh`.

## Why?

Jumpserver comes with web based terminal, it's good, but more happy work with a traditional terminal it make me more productive. so me build this tools to replace it on my workflow.
